I always find it more efficient to study at night, especially for creative work. It’s easier to have a clear mind and a different environment may offer some really interesting perspective. Also inspired by ‘Museum at the Night’, I thought it would be really fun if chairs and tables are alive at night and dance. So there starts my project.

Since I’m having a pretty weak computer, I try to pick models as simple as possible. I modified the original chair to T-pose and upload it to Mixamo which auto-generated rigging and animations. (The output was way better than I thought).

The music is Thriller by Michael Jackson. It matched the theme pretty well and there are tons of references on the internet. I learn a lot about camera movement for dance videos.
