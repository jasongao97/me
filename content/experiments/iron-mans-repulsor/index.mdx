It would be super cool if we can visualize our body movement by soft sensors. So I decided to make something like [Iron Man's Repulsor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FINPwdn4gnY), which could accumulate energy and release plasma. The LEDs would demonstrate the charging and the discharging process.

Materials:

- LilyPad - Arduino
- Speaker, LEDs, Flex sensor, Resistors
- Conductive Thread / Tape
- Fabric, Velcro
