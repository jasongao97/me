## Overview

In this pandemic time, how do people scattered around the world interact and entertain in a physical way? We created a real-time battle through the internet. Three players use different sensors to remotely control a car at the same place in the real world. Each car is equipped with canvas and spray gun, and players eliminate others by shooting paint on their canvas.

The team ideated 4 different gameplays to determine the battle, but after putting to the vote to the ITP class of 2022, we decided on the Paintball gameplay. Each RC car has a canvas and a paint gun mounted; and the players eliminate the others by shooting the paint on the other playersâ€™ mounted canvases.
