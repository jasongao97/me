## Overview

We designed a hanger for people with OCD. The hanger detects which side the user holds and automatically rotates the hook in the correct direction.

This project was developed for an imaginary Absurd Hotel in Japan. We designed and created an object for this hotel with a given set of CMF, including white oak, aluminum, transparent acrylic, white plastic, and malaquita for the color. This project is a collaboration between Michael Zhou and Jason Gao.

## Design

Each element of the hanger is designed with geometric shapes. We used a lot of repetition in the design to create harmony in this rather untraditional design. And stacking them together creates a cohesive yet unique form that reassembles a hanger.

### Mechanics

The mechanics of the hook is minimal and simple yet brilliant. Instead of pivoting the hook on the z-axis, we developed a mechanism that rotates on the y-axis. By turning a 270-degree arch from one end to the other, we achieved the purpose of changing hook direction. We essentially sliced a hook in the middle and integrated a gear in between. Then placed another gear that pairs with the one on the hook. We got a simple but elegant rotational mechanism that can be driven by a singular motor.

## Fabrication

We spent a tremendous amount of energy and attention fabricating this piece. We analyzed and used the most suitable technique available to us to create each individual component. We used the laser cutter to cut Delrin and assembled them into our hook mechanism with plastic glue. We 3D printed the central housing for the motor with tough white PLA. We did double-sided CNC on white oak to create our wooden frame with smooth curves and rounded ends. Every piece is hand-sanded and polished to get the final smooth finish that feels fanatic in hand.

We also designed the hanger assembly so it can be taken apart for fixation and updates quickly. Two pieces of the wooden frames are magnetically attached to each other. Motor and its housing are secured in place with a magnet and screws. And the placement of the housing is interlocked with the wooden frame, so they stay sturdy.
